  // dominoPointer subsets `presentables` & `results`, & contains display state. // hook the correct dominoPointer: if props exist, this domino's a recall-domino, and subset for the correct one. Else, hook the echo_dominoPointer. Note that React sets props as {} if not passed (which is truthy), so you have to check whether one of props' PROPERTIES is truthy. NOT the pairIndex, which is sometimes 0 (falsy).
  const dominoPointer = useStore((state) => props.leftOrRight ? state.testSlice.currentScreen.recall_dominoPointers[props.pairIndex][props.leftOrRight] : state.testSlice.currentScreen.echo_dominoPointer);
  // Targetpair is required by initializeRemainderString() (which cannot hook the store itself, since it's not a react component or custom hook).
  const targetPair = useStore((state) => state.testSlice.presentables.targetPairs[dominoPointer.namesOrObjects][dominoPointer.listHalf][dominoPointer.pairIndex]); // targetPair also includes a storyText and a storyTime, if it's for an objects-list. Unused, here.

  // useState() is a react hook for managing state locally (within the component). Helps unclutter the Zustand store.
  const [remainderString, setRemainderString] = useState(initializeRemainderString(targetPair, dominoPointer)); // remainderString is what users have left to type. It's an array of single-character-objects which get mapped into single-char <span> elements.
  const [userEntry, setUserEntry] = useState([]); // initialize userEntry with an empty array; they haven't typed anything yet.

  // Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesnâ€™t affect the visual output of your component.
  // useRef vs useState: useRef's great here bc it's synchronous, and lets wrongChar get detected AND USED within the same render cycle.
  // useRef vs local variable: useRef's value isn't destroyed each render cycle, whereas local variables get reinitialed each render back to their initial values.

  // these refs are only used inside handleKeyDown, but need to be declared at the component level (so that they persist across function calls)
  const targetLength = useRef(remainderString.length); // correct submissions have to be targetLength long. // targetLength initializes off the first remainderString render & is ready for the 2nd render.
  const firstSpace = useRef(false); // firstSpace becomes true in order to track whether they've pressed the spacebar a first time yet
  const wrongChar = useRef(false); // wrongChar === false means no typing-mistakes have been made. (Typing-mistakes include both wrong characters & exceeding the length of the targetString).
  //                               // wrongChar is actually used both inside handleKeyDown & in Domino (to conditionally render a space).

  // handleKeyDown: modify remainderString & userEntry; handle backspace & space (for reset & submit behaviors).
  // Outside handleKeyDown, though, first hook 2 additional Zustand setters (needed by handleKeyDown). (Hook best-practices: pass the RESULTS from hooks (such as a setter). Don't ever call hooks (eg useStore()) INSIDE a helper function. Only call them inside the react component itself, or inside a custom hook which is itself inside the react component.)
  const submitBad = useStore((state) => state.testSlice.submitBad); // problem: I tried to combine them into one, but it returned an object literal (a new object) rather than a ref to the one in state; this broke the hook's memoization capability. const { submitBad, setCorrect } = useStore((state) => ({submitBad: state.testSlice.submitBad, setCorrect: state.testSlice.setCorrect, }));
  const setCorrect = useStore((state) => state.testSlice.setCorrect);

  const boundHandleKeyDown = (e) => handleKeyDown(e, { remainderString, setRemainderString, userEntry, setUserEntry }, { targetLength, firstSpace, wrongChar }, dominoPointer.echoOrRecall, { submitBad, setCorrect }); // this boundHandleKeyDown wrapper cleans up the JSX (by keeping all these arguments out of it)

  // for focus & for placing caret. // begins null; points to the DOM object once it exists
  const dominoRef = useRef(null);

  // a custom hook I made, for handling initial focus (and centrally-managed whichFocus changes, for Recall)
  useDominoFocus(dominoPointer.echoOrRecall, // echo has one domino, which auto-focuses. Recall has 10 dominoes.
    dominoPointer.focused, dominoRef, props.dominoRefToFocus); // One of the recall dominoes has focused === true, in which case its dominoRef is passed to the centralized focus manager. (focused === undefined for echo; the key doesn't exist.)

  // Handle blur events by restoring focus. Either to this (single) Domino for echo, or using the central logic (if recall).
  const [blurCount, setBlurCount] = useState(0); // so that useCaretAtEnd runs whenever handleBlur does
  const handleBlur = () => { // Blur events are when the user tries to click elsewhere, and move the cursor elsewhere.
    setTimeout(() => { // Using setTimeout ensures that the blur event completes before restoring focus.
      if (dominoPointer.echoOrRecall === 'echo' && dominoRef.current) {
        dominoRef.current.focus();
      }
      else if (dominoPointer.echoOrRecall === 'recall') {
        props.restoreFocus();
      };
      setBlurCount((prev) => prev + 1); // Increment blurCount each blur event
    }, 0);
  };

  // Another custom hook: automatically place caret at the end of the userEntry string. (It's a hook bc it also contains useEffect(), listening for userEntry as a dependency.)
  useCaretAtEnd(dominoRef, userEntry, blurCount, //  (on mount, when userEntry changes, and whenever handleBlur fires).
    dominoPointer.echoOrRecall, dominoPointer.focused); // (Only when the domino's focused).

  // Conditionally hide the grey remainderString & linting (for recall dominoes, if their leftOrRight === 'rightHalf' && thisPairIsReinforcement === false). (&& returns a boolean.) Echo dominoes don't have either of those keys, so they'll return values of 'undefined', which makes the && return false. Good.
  // hideGreyRed's a local variable. It'll be created anew each render cycle, derived from values in dominoPointer. That's fine.
  const hideGreyRed = (dominoPointer.leftOrRight === 'rightHalf' && dominoPointer.thisPairNeedsReinforcement === false);
